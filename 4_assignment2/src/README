The Makefile assumes that the extras/, ia32/, intel64/ and source/ directories are present in the same directory as the makefile and the cpp sources. These directories are obtained from the Pin Tool tarball.
The .so file is made using the command make obj-intel64/cachetrace.so for a 64-bit processor, resulting in the .so file being generated inside a newly created obj-intel64 directory at the same directory level. The command is similar for a 32-bit based processor.
